# 🧪 Antibiotic Resistance Analysis

This project explores antibiotic resistance trends across gender, age groups, countries, and bacterial species using data from Europe (2000–2018). The goal is to identify high-risk populations and organisms with growing resistance.

## 🎯 SMART Questions Answered

1. Which gender shows higher resistance rates?
2. Are there specific bacteria with notable gender differences?
3. Which antibiotics are least effective by gender?
4. Which age group has the highest resistance?
5. Are elderly patients more resistant than younger groups?
6. Do some countries show higher child resistance?
7. Which bacteria are growing more resistant over time?

## ✅ Key Insight (Summary)
Aminopenicillins had the highest resistance rates overall. Males showed slightly higher resistance than females in most bacteria, while adults aged 19–64 had the highest resistance across age groups. Romania and Bulgaria had the highest child resistance rates. Resistance in *E. coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* is increasing steadily.
