# Key Insights from the Antibiotic Resistance Analysis (2000–2018)

## 🧬 Gender-Based Resistance Patterns
- Males consistently showed slightly higher antibiotic resistance than females across most European countries.
- Greece was an exception where **females** showed higher average resistance.
- While gaps were small, these trends suggest **minimal gender disparity**, but with potential regional exceptions.

## 🦠 Bacterial Resistance by Gender
- **Most bacteria** (e.g., *E. coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*) had slightly higher resistance in males.
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae** was the only major bacterium where **females** exhibited marginally higher resistance.
- These small but consistent variations could help shape **gender-sensitive public health strategies**.

## 💊 Antibiotic Class Resistance Trends
- **Aminopenicillins** had the **highest resistance rates** in both genders — suggesting declining effectiveness.
- Males showed higher resistance to most antibiotic classes.
- Females had slightly higher resistance to **penicillins** and **macrolides**, hinting at possible **gender-specific resistance patterns**.

## 👶👵 Age-Based Resistance Trends
- The **19–64 age group** showed the **highest resistance rates**, followed closely by the elderly (65+).
- **Children aged 0–4** had the **lowest resistance**, possibly due to less exposure.
- These patterns likely reflect **antibiotic exposure tied to lifestyle, immunity, and medical access**.

## 🌍 Country-Level Insights
- **Romania** recorded the **highest average resistance in children**, followed closely by **Bulgaria**.
- This may point to challenges in **antibiotic regulation** or **public health systems** in Eastern Europe.
- Targeted **pediatric stewardship programs** could be especially important in these countries.

## 📈 Trends in Specific Bacteria
- **E. coli** and **Klebsiella pneumoniae** showed a **steady increase** in resistance from 2000 to 2018.
- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** remained relatively **stable**.
- These trends highlight an **ongoing threat**, especially for vulnerable age groups, if resistance continues unchecked.
